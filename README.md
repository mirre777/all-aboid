# All-Aboid

# About

A simulation of the flocking behaviour of birds based on three simple rules which lets elements interact locally without having one leader or centralised system.

1 ALIGNMENT: Steer in the same direction as your neighbours.

2 SEPARATION: Steer to avoid colliding with your neighbours.

3 COHESION: Steer towards the center of your neighbours.

Simply said, they try not to crash into each other, adjust to each others speed and stay with the group.
